  <h1>Responsive design</h1>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p> A website with <br>responsive web design
        <br>
         is a site that is able
        to adapt the screen it is being used on, regardless of what
        device it is. The website automatically reformats to give the
        user a better experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        With responsive web design, all content and pages are
        flexible across all screen <br>resolutions and devices.
        Whether you’re viewing a website on your smartphone or a laptop,
        it will be unified and easy to navigate despite the differing screen sizes.<br> 
        Providing an optimal experience for the user across the board, 
        responsive web design means your user 
        can read and navigate the site with minimum resizing and scrolling
    </p>
